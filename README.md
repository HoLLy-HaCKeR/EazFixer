# EazFixer
A deobfuscation tool for Eazfuscator.

## Description
EazFixer is a deobfuscation tool for [Eazfuscator](https://www.gapotchenko.com/eazfuscator.net), a commercial .NET obfuscator. For a list of features, see the list below.

### Implemented features:
* String encryption
* Resource encryption
* Assembly embedding

### Considered features:
* Code and data virtualization
* Entrypoint obfuscation
* Useless code obfuscation (may only be present in Eazfuscator binary itself)

### Not considered:
* Symbol renaming (usually the symbol names are unrecoverable)
* Automatic code optimization (not an anti-feature!)
* Code control flow obfuscation (I didn't have any problems with my samples in dnSpy)
* Assemblies merging (doesn't seem probable, especially with symbol renaming)

## Usage
Call it from the command line with -f
`EazFixer.exe -f MyFile.exe`

Custom output file can be specified with -o param but by default the output will be Filename-eazfix.exe
`EazFixer.exe -f MyFile.exe -o OutFile.exe`

If your assembly is protected with control-flow obfuscation, run it through [de4dot](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot) with the
`--only-cflow-deob` flag first.

## Building
Clone the repository recursively and use the latest version of Visual Studio (2017, at the time of writing) to build.

## Support
EazFixer is (and will always be) targeted at the latest version of Eazfuscator. If your version is not supported, try a more universal 
deobfuscator like [de4dot](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot). If your version is newer than what this tool supports, create an issue only 
**after** verifying with the latest version of Eazfuscator.

Also, I will not help you use this program. Consider it for advanced users only. If you do run into a problem and are sure it is a bug, 
feel free to submit an issue but I cannot guarantee I will fix it.

## Credits
This tool uses the following (open source) software:
* [dnlib](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnlib) by [0xd4d](https://github.com/0xd4d), license under the MIT license, for reading/writing assemblies.
* a fork of [Harmony](https://github.com/hcoona/Harmony) by [hcoona](https://github.com/hcoona), licensed under the MIT license, to patch runtime methods.  
The original [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony) is by [Andreas Pardeike](https://github.com/pardeike), but does not unprotect the memory pages it writes to, making the program crash.
